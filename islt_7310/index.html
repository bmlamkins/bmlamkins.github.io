<p>My name is Megan Lamkins. I am a first-grade teacher in the suburbs of Saint Louis. I am entering my sixth year of teaching this upcoming school year. I completed my bachelor’s degree in Elementary Education from the University of Missouri-Kansas City in 2015; my master’s degree in Education with an emphasis in Character Education from Lindenwood University in 2017; and expect to complete my Education Specialist degree in Learning Technologies and Design from the University of Missouri-Columbia in May of 2021. Throughout the EdS program, I have developed the skills to design and develop innovative, aesthetic, effective and sustainable learning technologies based on theory-grounded research, critical and analytical skills for data collection and evaluation and can reflect and apply these skills to assess and evaluate learning systems, and competencies for socially responsible technology leadership.</p>
