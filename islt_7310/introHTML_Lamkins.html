    <title>Welcome to Megan Lamkins' Website</title>

<body>
	My name is Megan Lamkins. I am a first-grade teacher in the suburbs of Saint Louis. This upcoming school year will be my sixth year of teaching. I am married, and we have three fur babies. We really love spending time with our cats and dog.
	
	I do not currently have any web application or development training or experience. I am excited to learn a bit more about how to design a website in this course. With my learned web development skills, I plan to create some websites and use these skills in my current job.
	
	My favorite hobby is hiking and taking photos. This is what my husband and I do in our free time. We recently visited Yellowstone and Grand Teton. We are hoping to visit a few more National Parks this year to enjoy the outdoors and take some incredible photos. We are hoping to visit all of the US National Parks and some Canadian National Parks in upcoming years.
