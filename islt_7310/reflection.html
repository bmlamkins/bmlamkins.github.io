    <h1>Megan's Portfolio Reflection</h1>
    
    <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>
    
    <section><h2 style="text-align: left;">Throughout the Learning Technologies and Design Educational Specialist program, I have had the opportunity to expand my skillset. I have learned how to effectively analyze and present data; how to design and evaluate websites for a specific purpose; and how to create meaningful digital media to enhance the learning of my students. Each and every one of these experiences has changed who I am as an educator, and how I plan to move forward in my education career. I feel more confident that I can create meaningful learning experiences for students of all ages, and that I could design digital media and web pages to cultivate deeper understanding.</h2></section>
    
    <section><h2 style="text-align:left; text-indent: 50px;">As I reflect on how I will utilize these new skills and competencies moving forward, I feel that I have more opportunities. I am an elementary educator who works in a suburban district that is just beginning to meaningfully implement technology into classrooms. Because of this, completing this Learning Technologies and Design program is instrumental as I move forward as an educator. I plan to utilize my analytics skills to improve how data is collected, implemented, and analyzed by others in my building. I plan to utilize digital media to ensure that I am creating a culturally-relevant classroom where meaningful, fun learning happens. Finally, I plan to use my web page design and evaluation skills to analyze the effectiveness of certain learning platforms and websites that are frequently used in classrooms within the district. Using these newfound skills will help me advance within my school and within my district to improve learning outcomes for all students.</h2></section>
